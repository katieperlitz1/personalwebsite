    <h2>Business and Creative Work</h2>

    <h3>Kesper Design</h3>

    <p>
        Since 2019 I've been running my own graphic design business primarily through my Instagram page, @kesperdesign. I've created over 500 designs for high school athletes committing to college, graphics for sports teams and programs, and logos and YouTube thumbnails.

    <h4>How Does It Work?</h4>

    <!-- Source: (original work) Katie Perlitz -->
    <p>
        Players and teams message me on Instagram page and I negotiate pricing and fulfill their orders. I do anywhere from 5 to 15 edits per week and work with top players in lacrosse, football, soccer, basketball, hockey, and more.

    <h4>Kesper Golf Commits</h4>

    <!-- Source: (original work) Katie Perlitz -->
    <p>
        As a branch of Kesper Design, I have an editing page specifically for golf commitments: @kespergolfcommits. I've grown to 500 followers and completed over 50 edits since starting this page in Spring 2023, and am looking to grow it as the #1 golf recruitment page on Instagram.

    <h4>Etsy</h4>

    <p>
        I also design and sell Canva templates on Etsy for teams to use as social media graphics. These include schedules, player spotlights, Gameday announcements, tryouts/event flyers, and other necessary promotional posts. Since starting my store in Spring 2023, I've become a top seller in the sports graphics niche and have generated over $2500 in revenue. I'm looking to expand and scale my store with more products in the next few months!

    <h4>Video Editing</h4>

    <p>See the video edits I've made this year:</p>

    <!--I'm in the process of creating a video gallery/portfolio and will attach when I'm done. Would like each image of the video to be a link that bring them to see the video. So far only have Cornell Edit as a link. -->
