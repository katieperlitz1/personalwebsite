        I've been into sports and fitness for my whole life, whether I'm playing them, watching them, or designing for teams. I was a three-sport varsity athlete in high school (soccer, basketball, and lacrosse), and still love to stay active in college through running, lifting, and club basketball and lacrosse. My favorite sports to watch are football and basketball, and the excitement and energy surrounding big sports games or moments is something I love to capture in my graphics and videos.

        I love learning about businesses as much as I love creating them, and I frequently read business books, listen to business podcasts, and am fascinated about entrepreneurship. I've started (and failed!) new businesses every year since middle school, from eBay to dropshipping to Instagram theme pages, and have learned a ton about myself and the business world along the way.

        A newer hobby of mine is video editing, and I've especially enjoyed editing movie scenes and sports clips together to create epic videos. I'm currently learning Adobe After Effects to improve my videos. I'm also a movie lover, and always appreciate a good thriller or plot-twist film. Some of my favorites are Knives Out, Interstellar, Catch Me If You Can, and Parasite.

        I'm currently studying Information Science, Systems, and Technology at Cornell University, with a concentration in Interactive Technologies and a minor in Business. Some of my favorite classes so far have been Computing Inside Smartphones, Linear Algebra, and Intro to Programming with Python.
