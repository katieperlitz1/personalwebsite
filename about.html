        <h3 class="h32">Sports</h3>
        <p>
            I've always been into sports and fitness, whether I'm playing them, watching them, or designing for teams. I was a three-sport varsity athlete in high school (soccer, basketball, and lacrosse), and still love to stay active in college through running, lifting, and club basketball and lacrosse. My favorite sports to watch are football and basketball, and I love capturing the excitement and energy surrounding big sports moments in my graphics and videos.

    <div class="aboutdiv">
        <h3 class="h32">Business & Entrepreneurship</h3>
        <p>
            I love learning about businesses as much as I love creating them, and I'm always 
            reading business books, listening to business podcasts, and learning from the stories of entrepreneurs. 
            I've pursued business ideas every year since middle school -- from eBay to 
            building E-commerce stores to selling Instagram ads -- and have learned a ton about myself and business 
            along the way. I'm also a member of Epsilon Nu Tau, Cornell's Entrepreneurship fraternity.

    <div class="aboutdiv">
        <h3 class="h32">Film & Editing</h3>
        <p>
            A newer hobby of mine is video editing, and I've especially enjoyed editing movie scenes 
            and sports clips together to create videos. I'm currently learning Adobe After Effects 
            to improve my videos. I always appreciate great film and production, and especially love thriller or 
            plot-twist movies. Some of my favorites are Knives Out, Interstellar, Catch Me If You Can, 
            and Parasite.

    <div class="aboutdiv">
        <h3 class="h32">Education</h3>
        <p>
            I'm currently studying Information Science, Systems, and Technology at Cornell University, 
            with a concentration in Interactive Technologies and a minor in Business. Some of my 
            favorite classes so far have been Computing Inside Smartphones, Linear Algebra, and 
            Discrete Structures.
