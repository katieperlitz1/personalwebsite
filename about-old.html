          <h3 class="h32">Sports & Fitness</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve always been into sports and fitness — whether I’m playing them, watching them, or designing for teams. I was a three-sport varsity athlete in high school (soccer, basketball, and lacrosse) and still stay active through running, lifting, and playing club basketball and lacrosse at Cornell. <br><br>
            <strong>College basketball</strong> is hands-down my favorite to watch, and I love capturing the energy and hype of big moments through my graphics and videos. <br><br> Lately, I’ve been training for <strong>Hyrox</strong> races — I competed in my first in Summer 2025 and am gearing up for my next one this winter.

          <h3 class="h32">Business & Entrepreneurship</h3>
          <p>
            I love learning about businesses as much as I love creating them. In my free time you'll find me reading business books and <strong>listening to podcasts</strong>, exploring investing trends, and obsessing over how AI will shape the future. <br><br>
            I’ve tried a new business idea almost every year since middle school — eBay, Shopify, selling ads on my viral Insta page — and every project taught me something about building, failing, and iterating.
            <br><br> I'm also a member of Epsilon Nu Tau, <strong>Cornell's Entrepreneurship fraternity</strong>, and am building a college tour startup with friends Fall 2025!

          <p>
            A newer hobby of mine is video editing, and I've especially enjoyed editing movie scenes 
            and sports clips together to create videos. I'm currently learning Adobe After Effects 
            to improve my videos. <br><br> I always appreciate great film and production, and especially love thriller or 
            plot-twist movies. Some of my favorites are Knives Out, Interstellar, Catch Me If You Can, 
            and Parasite. <br><br> Whenever anyone asks what I'd do if money were no object, I say I'd <strong>work on movie trailers or music videos</strong>.

          <p>
            I’m currently studying Information Science, Systems, and Technology at Cornell University, with a concentration in Interactive Technologies and UX Design and a minor in Business. Courses like Computing Inside Smartphones, Discrete Structures, App Design & Prototyping, and Business Idea Factory have been some of my favorites so far.
